## Introduction

The QR Code to Binary File Decoder is a web-based application that allows users to reconstruct binary files from a series of QR codes. This tool is designed to work in conjunction with the Binary to QR Code Encoder, providing a complete solution for file transfer or backup using QR codes.

## Features

- Camera-based QR code scanning using device camera
- Real-time QR code detection and decoding
- Progress tracking with both linear and segmented progress bars
- Estimated time remaining for file reconstruction
- Support for partial scans and ability to resume from missing chunks
- File information display including filename and total number of chunks
- Download link generation for reconstructed files
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A device with a camera (for QR code scanning)
- Internet connection (for loading the required libraries)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qr-code-to-binary-decoder.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd qr-code-to-binary-decoder/qr2b
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted.
3. Click the "Start Scanning" button to begin scanning QR codes.
4. Point your camera at the QR codes generated by the Binary to QR Code Encoder.
5. The application will automatically detect and process the QR codes.
6. Once all chunks are scanned, a download link will appear for the reconstructed file.

## Examples

### File Information QR Code

The first QR code scanned contains file information in the following JSON format:

```
{
  "filename": "example.bin",
  "chunks": "42"
}
```

### Data Chunk QR Codes

Subsequent QR codes represent chunks of the file data in the following JSON format:

```
{
  "chunk": "1",
  "total_chunks": "42",
  "data": "base64EncodedDataString"
}
```

## Configuration

The application doesn't require any specific configuration. It automatically adapts to the QR codes being scanned.

## Limitations

- The quality of the camera and lighting conditions can affect QR code recognition.
- Very large files may result in a high number of QR codes, which can be time-consuming to scan.
- The application relies on client-side processing, so device performance may impact scanning speed.

## Troubleshooting

- If the camera isn't working, ensure you've granted the necessary permissions in your browser.
- If QR codes aren't being recognized, try adjusting the lighting or distance from the codes.
- Clear your browser cache if you experience unexpected behavior.

## FAQ

Q: Can I scan the QR codes in any order?
A: Yes, the application can handle QR codes scanned in any order.

Q: What happens if I miss a QR code?
A: The application will indicate missing chunks, allowing you to rescan only the missing parts.
